<h2>My trip to London, New York & Paris</h2>
<p>During my time in London I went to a small 1£ store. I was quite amazed that you are able to buy so many things for only 1£, most of it was food or drinks though.
   I also was able to get a few fun souvernirs that would remind me of my time in london.<br>
   
   The same summer I also went to New York. This was 1 of my places on my bucketlist. Because you are not able to pay with €
